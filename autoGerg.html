            <h1>Auto Gerg</h1>
            <h2>(A new take on autobattlers)</h3>
            <p>
                Auto Gerg is a project my friends and I designed for
                Game Design and Human-Centered Computing classes.
                We wanted to make an autobattler much like TFT,
                or Auto Chess, but we wanted to make it our own.
                That is where Gerg came in. The name Gerg is a play
                on our friend's name Greg, (which was just his name
                spelled backwards,) who was the previous president of
                the game development club. Greg was a good friend of
                ours who graduated the semester before and because Gerg
                had become a meme within the Game Dev Club, we decided
                to use the name as a stepping stone in our game. One of
                the classes the characters in the game was called the
                cultists which ideally would summon GERG if the
                requirements were met who was designed to be one of
                the more powerful characters the player could use.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                Auto Gerg was designed to be an autobattler similar to TFT
                and Auto Chess. If you are not familiar with these games,
                they are essentially several players picking and choosing
                characters and setting them on their side of the field.
                The player's characters then fight one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                For our game we decided to make a 2-player local version of 
                autobattlers. We made several characters split into 3
                different classes, each with their own stats, strenghts
                and weaknesses. Although with the time we were given, we did
                not quite get the chance to finish the game, We managed to
                have a decent prototype for what we wanted the game to
                become. The game lacked character models and animations
                above all else since we did not have anyone on our team
                capable of doing that. However what we did have the
                knowledge and skills to do, we ensured that we put our
                all into it.
