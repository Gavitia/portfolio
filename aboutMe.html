            <p>
                I am a 21 year old man who wants to become a 
                software developer. I may not have much experience, 
                but I am a quick learner and I hope to use my skills 
                to be able to create something I can be proud of. 
                I have always wanted to create something and with the 
                knowledge I have, becoming a software developer is the
                best way to do that.

            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <h3>Game Development Club</h3>
            <p>
                I joined the Game Development Club back in 2017. 
                It was my first semester in college and I did 
                not know how to even code before then. This is 
                the main reason why I decided to continue on as
                a CS major. I became an officer in the club in 
                2018, and by the end of 2019 I became the president
                of the club.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to use my time in the club to teach others
                how to use both Unity and Unreal. I know that it 
                can be intimidating when you first begin because
                I had the same fears of not knowing anything when
                I began. For me, I learned the best with on-the-job
                work, but I know that different people have different
                styles of learning and so we try to combine traditional
                learning styles along with hands-on experience working
                on games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though I have been with Game Development for some
                time, I know that I still need alot to learn before
                being entirely prepared for the job market. There are
                many things that I have yet to learn, but I look forward
                to these experiences and I hope that I can be as useful
                to my future employers as I would like to be.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                I worked for a year as a student web developer for the
                Physical Science Laboratory at NMSU. Much of my
                time involved using transfering many of the school's
                website's pages over from drupal to wordpress. However,
                my biggesst project I worked on was a website that
                pulled the school's news RSS feed and displayed that
                information out on the screen. In the process of creating
                this, I learned how to use PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                and how to use these all together to create and design a
                website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This job helped me learn that I needed more than school
                to learn the things that I want to do. I have always
                had problems learning in a classroom setting, but when
                I am in the real world working hands-on on a project,
                information sticks with me alot better. I realized
                this during this job experience because I was much more
                inspired to apply myself to the job than I was to my
                classes. As much as I loved working here, I knew that
                if I continued, I would not be able to finish my school
                work becasue it interested me so much more.
            </p>
            <h3>Energy Management</h3>
            <p>
                I worked for two semesters with the department of
                Facilities & Services and during that time the priority
                of my job was reading all of the gas, electric, and water
                meters to properly charge every building for their use. I
                did also have to change the stickers on several of the
                meters over my time working here. I had a few smaller
                projects like this, but there was one that was a bigger
                project. I had to make a map on Google Earth to show where
                every single meter was and how to reach the ones that were
                either hidden or placed somewhere underground. The map also
                allowed for a person to tell them by the type of meter you
                were looking for. The last this this map included was a
                route that we used to reach each meter in the quickest way
                possible.
